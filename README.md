# Pandas, ORM, API Project
In this project, we use Pandas, ORM and API to create and operate a database for retail store management. The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is given in `retail_store_managment_erd.png`. There are 7 main entities; store, product, manufacturer, category, product_lot, bill and customer. To represent some many-to-many relationships, 2 additional entities; store_product and product_bill are also created.

The repository is divided into branches for each team members with their respective names. In the main branch, in root folder, code for database creation is given in `database_creation.py` and address of database_engine is given in `dbaddress.py`. Codes done by respective members are given in their respective name folders, in their respective name branches.

Work division is done as follows:
1. Database creation and dummy data fill using ORM - [Pujan](www.github.com/pujan-dahal)
2. Insertion APIs with ORM - [Shijal](www.github.com/Shijal12)
3. Retrieval APIs with ORM - [Baburam](www.github.com/baburam-shrestha)
4. Insights into data - All
